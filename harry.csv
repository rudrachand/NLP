1140,"He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked."
36527,The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air.
36521,"But how the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him."
36406,Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?
36395,"Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl."
36383,"Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet, it seemed to draw every eye."
36302,"Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss."
36225,"Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was?"
36207,It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry's eyes.
36203,"I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look...."
36175,Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating.
36154,"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested."
36029,"They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid."
36005,"He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here...."
35930,"How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?"
35800,"Snape seemed to shrink a little, ""You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child?"
35776,"But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again..."
35773,"The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape's step..."
35736,She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window.
35729,Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby.
35640,"As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred."
35575,The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain.
35500,"He knows I'm after Horcruxes ¨C he's keeping Nagini close beside him ¨C obviously I'm going to have to go to him to get near the thing¨C""""Right,"" said Ron, squaring his shoulders."
35478,"He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them..."
35473,Hermione screamed.She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry.
35395,"We can't order them to die for us ¨C ""There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms."
35391,"Ginny,"" said Harry, ""I'm sorry, but we need you to leave too."
35370,"Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway."
35345,"It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was..."
35296,"He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them."
35204,"Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape¨C Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers."
35184,"Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape¨C""""Let me ¨C""""¨Cand if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible."
35179,"Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own."
35158,"We can push it off on the kids,"" said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty."
35157,Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room.
35126,"The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above."
35096,"If you'd like to see what the diadem's supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry."
35078,"Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural ..."
35012,"Yeah, well, I couldn't ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts."
34979,"Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville."
34944,"He didn't like that."" said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again."
34917,"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys."
34872,"Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard."
34823,Harry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present.
34820,Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?
34816,"Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first..."
34697,"Hide,"" said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness."
34691,"I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault ..."
34678,"Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass."
34658,"Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious."
34618,"The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May."
34597,"She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun."
34574,"It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it."
34559,"Lupin,"" muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open.Lupin fell over the threshold."
34534,"Anyway,"" Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, ""Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening."
34531,"Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue."
34475,"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost,"" said Harry."
34394,"I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew."
34386,"Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument."
34362,The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton.
34351,"They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished."
34189,"The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor."
34168,"No ¨C ""Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it."
34036,"No,"" snarled Greyback, ""I haven't got ¨C they say he's using the Malfoy's place as a base."
33991,"I'b Bardy,"" said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood."
33980,"Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction."
33899,"The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone...and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield..."
33881,"That symbol doesn't mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can't afford to get sidetracked ¨C""Harry was barely listening to her."
33871,"Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon."
33866,"If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death?"
33848,He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world.
33842,"And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match..."
33705,The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron.
33558,"All's fair in love and war,"" said Ron brightly, ""and this is a bit of both."
33519,"Oh yeah,"" said Ron at once, ""people are talking about it quite a lot."
33508,"Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, ""Dumbledore... the doe?"
33492,He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket.
33466,"One thing I would like to know, though,"" she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron's head."
33409,The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant.
33281,"He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared."
33267,"He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady."
33210,"As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here.Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore."
33195,"Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias ""Dogbreath"" Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school.The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore's mother's death."
33182,"You said everything, even if you don't remember it."
33150,"Hermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand."
33096,"He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all..."
33088,"The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut..."
33072,"And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions..."
32975,Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted; what if ¨C?
32907,"After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione's beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago."
32760,"Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts."
32743,When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up the wooded slope.
32585,"Harry's voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white hand."
32540,Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask ¨C about whether Mrs. Cattermole's lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband ¨C died in his throat.
32513,"Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people."
32461,"If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, and otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention."
32452,"Patronuses,"" said Harry, pointing his wand at his own."
32441,"Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.It was Umbridge's lie that brought the blood surging into Harry's brain and obliterated his sense of caution ¨C that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials."
32431,She cried harder than ever.Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her.
32411,"Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly."
32384,"He addressed Mr. Weasley's shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other's eyes."
32357,A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner.
32336,"A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner."
32288,"With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift."
32264,The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it.
32245,"I'm sorry to hear you're under the weather,"" said Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street."
32213,"Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom."
32186,"If anyone shouldn't go, it's Harry, he's got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head ¨C """"Fine, I'll stay here,"" said Harry."
32183,"All right,"" said Ron slowly, ""let's say we go for it tomorrow ..."
32180,"He could tell from Ron's and Hermione's faces that they were scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood."
32173,"Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,"" Ron said."
32120,"Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,"" croaked the elf."
32043,"I thought you'd say that,"" said Lupin, looking disappointed."
31932,"Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed ..."
31868,"The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR."
31852,"Hermione,"" he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm."
31843,He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him.
31838,There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry's liking.
31765,"He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible."
31734,"Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his."
31699,"We didn't kill you ¨C ""On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, ""It's all r-right...."
31589,"Yes I was,"" said Doge, through trembling lips, ""and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember."
31559,"Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur's cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing ""Odo the Hero"" in the corner.Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron's who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table."
31528,"His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation."
31493,Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time.
31466,"Sorry about last night,"" she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle."
31463,"Not so fast, Your Holeyness,"" said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading for the procession, he said, ""Here ¨C permetiez moi to assister vous,"" to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside."
31356,"The vast majority of his possessions ¨C his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects ¨C were left to Hogwarts."
31354,"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will?"
31342,"We're not going anywhere,"" said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously."
31335,"Yes, of course,"" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous."
31334,"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,"" said Scrimgeour."
31319,Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out.
31298,"She was really cut up when you ended it¨C""""So was I."
31287,"Nice view,"" he said feebly, pointing toward with window.She ignored this."
31214,"The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival."
31197,This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux.
31173,"Once we've left, the ghoul's going to come and live down here in my room,"" said Ron."
31161,"I ¨C Hermione, I'm sorry ¨C I didn't ¨C """"Didn't realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you?"
31128,"Yes, good point,"" said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment."
31106,"Oh, of course not,"" said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone."
31104,"Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you¨C""""I didn't misunderstand,"" said Harry flatly."
31053,"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,"" said Mr. Weasley."
30977,Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before.
30934,"Second later, Harry's feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow."
30890,Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him.
30884,"Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button."
30872,He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace.
30822,"Don't forget the glasses, there's six pairs in the side pocket."
30792,"Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother's charm does that already."
30717,"Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs."
30706,"Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, ""But what about my work?"
30663,"He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect."
30488,"I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans."
30410,"Scrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding."
30378,"Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved."
30369,"Dumbledore was dead, gone ... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on ... there was movement among the trees."
30324,The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows.
30314,"His animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy's voice on that Tower top, northe fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived."
30269,"Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palo-minos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest."
30267,"Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral."
30252,"Yes,"" said Harry.She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed."
30220,"It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagall's office, but for Dumbledore's, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress, . . ."
30201,"Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled."
30142,"Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide."
30128,Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment.
30109,Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing.
30101,"It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground."
30098,"Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve."
30085,"He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . ."
30058,"And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground."
30056,"And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you?"
30054,"He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been."
30023,He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ...
30006,"Til do it,' snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared."
29993,He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice.
29861,"His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so ..."
29851,"And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an anti-dote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably."
29842,His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it.
29814,He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it.
29741,Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock.
29677,"He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder's Map and a pair of balled-up socks."
29639,"She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore's corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry."
29618,"Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure."
29597,"Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment."
29595,He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny.
29511,"The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry's; he tried not to look into them."
29460,"He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment."
29424,The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up.
29389,"Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends."
29377,When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione.
29296,"I did not wish to be-lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense."
29289,"No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it."
29257,The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around.
29238,"Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-bling as usual upon his ruff."
29219,"Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little."
29165,"He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid's, delighted with himself."
29111,It could not have been plainer that he thought this les-son was a waste of time.
29084,"Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet  -  Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them  -  for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves."
29063,"Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance."
29042,"When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-proached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron's Appari-tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Harry."
28995,"Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled."
28968,They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years.
28913,"She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter."
28798,"After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown."
28782,There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly.
28743,"I've told you,"" said Harry patiently, ""he could be world-class and I wouldn't want to keep him."
28703,"Yer expect accidents, don' yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha's tliff'rent."
28465,"Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn."
28431,"The exception sits before me,"" Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry's scar."
28392,"I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Volde-mort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother's family  -  the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death."
28391,Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts.
28381,"He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much."
28313,"He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys' kitchen and Mrs. Weasley's tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall's office."
28242,"Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher, Harry stared at it."
28232,"Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed."
28228,"Abandoning pretense, Harry said, ""And it wasn't Sirius?"
28219,"At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike."
28180,"It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . ."
28165,"Harry remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing."
28154,"Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see."
28153,"There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, ""Ah . . ."
28147,"They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful."
28129,"I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l  -  why even Severus  - "" And to Harry's horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them."
28123,"Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, ""Let ' s get something straight."
28055,She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill.
27990,"Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly."
27983,"But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky  -  Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky."
27973,"With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor's six goals."
27940,"The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached."
27880,"The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time."
27832,"Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his hall' moon spectacles."
27817,"Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious."
27796,"Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised."
27761,"Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore's, as though trying to catch one of them lying."
27752,My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts.
27693,"She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore."
27690,Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean.
27675,I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer.
27662,"He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold."
27655,She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove.
27642,"Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started dis-cussing what had happened."
27628,"When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione."
27616,"Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron's gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up."
27568,"Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand."
27545,The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
27501,"He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown."
27434,Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.
27418,"Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green."
27404,"The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another."
27342,"Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return."
27341,I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion.
27321,"Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man."
27265,"Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again."
27262,"Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once."
27249,"As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake."
27247,"Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking."
27235,Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep down-ward slope.
27220,"He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight."
27215,But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.
27191,"Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making."
27158,"Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise."
26996,"Exactly,"" said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands."
26986,"He's got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it  -  nice big cave."
26974,"I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately."
26962,Hadn't it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
26905,Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful.
26830,"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry,"" said Malfoy.""?"
26757,"Harry and Neville caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight."
26709,He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing.
26659,"Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look."
26639,"Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts  -  or at least, to be seen buying them."
26607,"Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off."
26589,"Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed."
26549,"See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o' Aurors, but Dumbledore said I'd do,"" said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets."
26505,All three of them lifted their right legs.Harry moved forward.
26319,"It was cruel,"" said Dumbledore softly, ""that you and Sirius had such a short time together."
26300,"Horace,"" said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, ""likes his comfort."
26293,"Well, I'm sorry you don't want the job, Horace,"" said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute."
26287,I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones's death did not shake me. . . .
26278,Haven't I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students?
26274,He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction.
26167,He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube.
26141,"I'll just go and  -  er  -  finish off,"" said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron."
26067,"Hoping to see you this Friday,I am, yours most sincerely,Albus DumbledoreThough he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive."
26044,"For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,"" said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.Most seem reassured by the new Minister's tough stand on student safety."
26003,"You are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . ."
25996,"Severus,"" she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks."
25991,"But  - """"If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,"" said Snape at once."
25929,"Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn."
25920,"Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions."
25914,"The Dark Lord,"" he said, raising his glass and draining it.The sisters copied him."
25907,"I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,"" said Snape silkily."
25903,"As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,"" said Snape lazily.The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room."
25863,Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak.
25807,Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.
25772,"The Minister of Magic only reveals him - or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,"" said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket."
25576,"He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred Dementors . . ."
25342,"Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain at Headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment."
25319,"So you see, I have been trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry."
25318,"He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him."
25197,"This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip."
25186,Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates.
25080,He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville.
25073,The prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out.
25064,"Harry's heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand."
25054,"He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish - '    He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken p t where the stone archway stood on its dais."
25025,"The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them."
25017,"A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly."
24987,"The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eaters shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered - '    The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar."
24961,The problem was going to be conveying it to the others.
24956,"A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand, but Malfoy had deflected it; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered."
24934,"More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman laughed loudest of all."
24868,"The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room."
24823,She moved forward to look through the side of the tank.
24821,"The place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid, big enough for all of them to swim in; a number of pearly-white objects were drifting around lazily in it."
24820,"After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, shimmering lights as Harry had seen in his dreams."
24792,"The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat and the house-elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool."
24780,"Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna."
24777,"He made as though to stride away from his Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost tell over again."
24762,Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as he willed it to go even faster.
24746,"He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others."
24686,Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to Stun one of them; then she screamed very loudly.
24612,There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the Slytherins' efforts to keep Ron and the others under control.
24554,"All right, whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them."
24515,"He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside, and leaned against it, facing them."
24447,They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.
24390,Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them.
24374,"Sure enough, he found the written paper difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he could describe its effects accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year."
24368,"They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess."
24340,"As small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements, occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake."
24331,He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here.
24232,"How could Hagrid, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?"
24214,"The giant let go of the top of the tree, which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of pine needles, and looked down."
24207,"He was, as    Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall."
24152,Hagrid's face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad.
24141,The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk.
24131,"Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the Forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree."
24100,"The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams."
23985,"Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never."
23927,"Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse."
23903,She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.
23900,"Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . ."
23836,"James roared at Snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him."
23780,"To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going."
23758,"With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up."
23725,He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.
23721,"Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right."
23684,Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them.
23675,"There was something in this room he wanted very, very much . . ."
23661,"Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour later; and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word 'POO'."
23656,Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them.
23641,"Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went; shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched."
23587,Fred and George turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch.
23570,"Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, closely followed by Crabbe and Goyle."
23535,"The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little, away from the wall."
23418,"The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly."
23412,"Harry, who had some experience of Dobby s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats."
23389,"When he'd repeated Firenze's words, Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken aback."
23330,"He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting."
23321,"He looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk, and said, 'You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge."
23264,"Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away."
23185,"Before he knew what had happened, her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear, 'I'm really, really sorry."
23139,"It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close down."
23085,"Rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter."
23043,"Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help."
22998,"Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . ."
22958,"The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake."
22947,"Ron seemed to have noticed Harry's tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards."
22918,The news of his parents' attackers' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him.
22901,"When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly."
22892,"There were relatives cf their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry."
22873,"He was in the bed opposite Lockhart's, just lying there, staring at the ceiling."
22838,"He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind's resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years."
22833,"The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth, yet he knew they were true."
22800,"Harry left without another word, closing the door carefully behind him, his scar still throbbing painfully."
22791,"Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved."
22646,"That nights meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr Weasley back amongst them."
22635,"Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them."
22589,"There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart's angry voice."
22567,Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here.
22541,And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming.
22517,"Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them."
22516,A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital.
22510,"Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry a:id Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin."
22488,"Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself."
22477,"What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth."
22445,He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them.
22404,"I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts . . ."
22368,"They're sure they'll find an antidote, though; they say they've had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour."
22307,"He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark."
22280,"It sounded to Harry, too, as though Mr Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death."
22264,"They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table."
22251,"Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks."
22239,"It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said 'three', Harry looked up at him - they were very close together - and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry's face."
22198,"He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes."
22103,Hermione gave Ron a look or deep disgust and returned to her letter.
22100,"Harry looked from Ron's expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione's slight frown, and nodded."
22095,"Just as he had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands."
22085,He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes . . .
22045,"People froze for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx."
22022,"In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas."
21933,"The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid."
21880,Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap.
21843,"That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin' down on the valley."
21778,Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising.
21741,"And with a look of the utmost satisfaction, Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in her wake."
21698,"Course I am, said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet."
21636,As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise.
21628,"When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they came within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time, too."
21578,"He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions."
21564,"Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm."
21553,"I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm."
21546,"Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him."
21506,"He expected the elf's smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say it was impossible, or else that he would try to find somewhere, but his hopes were not high."
21444,"Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses, but he could still tell that everyone's face was turned towards him."
21436,"In fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing."
21403,The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.
21313,"The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent."
21308,Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.
21306,"Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention."
21301,"Nevilles face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth."
21299,"Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight."
21258,"Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too."
21232,"There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry's feet."
21183,This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.
21177,"Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells - '    'We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione, 'is that she's got some . . . some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army."
21165,There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table.
21150,"Zacharias said dismissively, 'All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts."
21128,The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed.
21091,"They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes."
21086,"With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all."
21084,The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy.
21047,"He wished he had not smashed the bowl of Murtlap essence    'Well . . . think about it,' said Hermione quietly."
20991,Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she realised Professor McGonagall would not permit it.
20977,"Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her."
20892,The Hogwart's HighInquisitorThey had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter.
20835,"I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the 'Fred and George' route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility."
20775,Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch.
20774,"Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind."
20715,There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion.
20707,"That Umbridge woman's foul,' she said in a low voice."
20687,She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.
20565,"He let no gasp of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but 'good evening' and 'goodnight'."
20433,There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence.
20375,The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him.
20368,"She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Harry stood up, too."
20337,"He had hardly spoken to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates."
20272,Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order 'wands away' had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting.
20246,The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes.
20210,Snape's mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class's silence.
20167,Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables.
20137,"But apparently he was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room."
20121,"He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus."
20118,"They don't know our Headmaster's been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he's losing his marbles - '    'My gran says that's rubbish,' piped up Neville."
20052,The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.
20022,"There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate - for food had appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice."
19934,"If he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too."
19916,Harry saw Ron checking his reflection in the black window.
19880,Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azhaban.
19843,"He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap."
19749,"But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs Weasley silly."
19659,Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it.
19650,"Drawing room . . .' he growled, as the pupil contracted."
19641,It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks.
19640,It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived.
19620,"What about those adventures he, Ron and Hermione had had together since starting at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?"
19606,But if he had remembered . . . if he had thought about it . . . what would he have expected?
19577,"Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying."
19555,"Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival."
19431,"A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs Figg."
19406,"Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley - '    'Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,' said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck."
19404,"Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came."
19381,The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes.
19367,"Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not."
19348,"A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt."
19322,His eyes had darted from the silver visitor's badge on Harry's chest to his forehead.
19311,"Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of their wands, the point of the centaurs a tow, the tip of the goblin's hat and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall    'This way,' said Mr Weasley."
19310,The last three were all locking adoringly up at the witch and wizard.
19283,"They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases."
19217,"Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers-by."
19215,"Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry's relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, and she also seemed too busy to linger."
19212,"The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks."
19211,"Snape might refer to their work as 'cleaning', but in Harry's opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher."
19164,"Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort."
19031,"His comeback didn't come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see."
18985,"And if you'll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all 'is own toads back orf me for a lot more'n what 'e paid in the first place - '    'I don't think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus,' said Mrs Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forwards on to the table, howling with laughter."
18982,If they're offered the freedoms we've been denying them for centuries they're going to be tempted.
18969,"Mrs Weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of Butterbeer on lo the table, and spilling almost as much again."
18962,"There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the Headmaster."
18847,"He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione."
18769,"They were standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen."
18767,He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry's hand and set fire to it with his wand-tip.
18741,"Harry's eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm."
18726,"Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him.    ' - the others keep flying, don't stop, don't break ranks."
18721,"Tonks'll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail."
18708,"Holding her wand like a conductors baton, Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig's cage in her left hand."
18699,"Well, that's a bit better - I've never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells."
18694,"But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be packing,' she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor."
18469,"It zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannon-ball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright."
18444,"He was straining his ears to catch any noises outside, in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon's questions than to have him start raging and bellowing."
18427,"He spotted it at once: a dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed window."
18410,One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart.
18407,"Hoping you are well,    Yours sincerely,    Mafalda Hopkirk    Improper Use of Magic Office    Ministry of MagicHarry read the letter through twice."
18405,Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
18383,"Dudley swayed on the spot for a moment, his face pale green . . . then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat."
18281,"From the little he could see of Dudley's large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look."
18250,"Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his 'delinquent' appearance when he passed the householders."
18248,"Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home alter Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off towards the park gate."
18230,Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn't think that Dudley earning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration.
18222,The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park.
18178,Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o'clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet - but was there any point continuing to take it?
18122,"Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit 'n' Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past."
18101,"He left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe,  and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks."
18050,"Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag."
18024,The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King's Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September.
17942,"When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing."
17927,Migh' be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold.
17791,"He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back."
17788,That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains.
17760,"There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.-""  When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight's events,"" said Snape, in a low voice; he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question."
17739,Mrs. Weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed-covers unnecessarily.
17731,"It wasn't as though he didn't want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand."
17678,Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm.
17621,"She looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick."
17613,"When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father's body."
17584,He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.
17538,Winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers.
17477,Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father.
17438,"They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban."
17428,"Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice."
17420,"Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all."
17412,There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor.
17370,"He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moodys unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible."
17363,"There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody's office was blasted apart -Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor."
17345,"But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it."
17308,Moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile.
17285,"He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry's face."
17224,"More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from its tip ...  the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . ."
17084,"I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality."
17079,"Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters."
17047,A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake.
17043,I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you.
16990,"He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying."
16954,"He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night."
16850,"Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind him."
16771,"When none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again."
16763,The spell hit the skrewt's armor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
16740,"He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran  away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight."
16724,He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist.
16701,"Harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do...."
16694,"He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side."
16660,"Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions."
16659,"The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear."
16587,"A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue ""as worthy of investigation."
16584,But he's made friends with werewolves and giants too.
16570,Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.
16541,Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment.
16535,Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .
16533,He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ...
16496,"I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays."
16493,"Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him."
16490,"Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair."
16449,"Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl."
16416,"He was shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milk-white."
16398,Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap.
16377,"Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes."
16323,"There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms."
16289,It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle.
16248,"I agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we've no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all."
16144,He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous night.
16129,"When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it."
16100,"The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its beak."
16085,I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he's bin lately.
16047,"He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley's there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you. ..."
15979,"However, he nodded politely like the other champions."
15968,"Harry and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges."
15952,"No, I haven't actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior's handwriting."
15915,Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.
15898,It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures.
15876,"Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read."
15860,"The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs."
15814,What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box?
15811,"Crouch, though . . . he's a different matter ... is he really ill?"
15805,"Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration."
15771,Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.
15764,"He had his supporters, mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic."
15749,"He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer."
15729,Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets.
15720,Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban.
15702,"Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village."
15666,"In truth, he hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape."
15618,"Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual."
15605,Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one.
15584,"If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been."
15580,"Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows. . . ."
15512,"Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free."
15501,"Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips."
15482,"The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong."
15457,"Harry tried to shout - but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble."
15431,"His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain."
15368,"People kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid s, all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task."
15348,Why had he ever let his mind wander in class - what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater?
15279,"They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before."
15165,A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner - Snapes office.
15151,She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly.
15144,"Harry said, ""Well, does anything in there have a human voice?"
15127,"He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps."
15123,"Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it."
14982,"Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done."
14944,"Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too."
14937,"Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants."
14808,"Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) - if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really an option."
14778,"Apparently Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public."
14772,"The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen."
14714,"And we 'ave choirs of wood nymphs, 'oo serenade us as we eat."
14635,There was  just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else.
14608,"Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed."
14579,Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future.
14397,"Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid."
14358,He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione.
14308,Each of them was now approaching six feet in length.
14243,"When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as Cedric's. . . ."
14173,Bagman was shouting something. . . but Harry's ears were not working properly anymore. . . listening wasn't important....
14163,There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot.
14131,"Mr. Diggory, you're first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right?"
14087,"Just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come."
14056,"Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it."
14037,"What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room."
14032,"When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class."
13989,He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed.
13961,"Just -""  But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst."
13902,She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him.
13879,"Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting - torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks."
13828,The back of Hagrid's enormous shaggy head - he had mercifully abandoned his bunches -emerged over the crowd.
13821,"He'd have been really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was...cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands..."
13669,"Even though he wasn't speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence:  An ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes  -  ""Ignore the quill, Harry,"" said Rita Skeeter firmly."
13556,"Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed."
13539,"He'll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone's entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -""  ""He'd want you to tell him,"" said Hermione sternly."
13472,"Yes, he'd thought about it. . . he'd fantasized about it..  . but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream. . . he'd never really, seriously considered entering. ."
13459,"Very enthusiastic. . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . ."
13427,"Mr. Bagman,"" said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, ""you are our -er - objective judges."
13400,"Gentlemen. . . lady,"" he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three."
13389,"Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire."
13363,"There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore."
13304,Them champions're going ter have their work cut out.
13284,Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.
13261,"Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop."
13239,He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn't believe his eyes.
13186,"He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise."
13125,"They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive."
13046,"When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight."
12984,"He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session."
12924,Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other.
12907,It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.
12889,Moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry.
12885,"All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard."
12843,"Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron."
12835,"She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified."
12815,The spider leapt from Moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze.
12814,"Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it."
12737,"FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC  It seems as though the Ministry of Magic's troubles are not yet at an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent."
12732,"Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class."
12675,"Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil."
12673,"Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn't even got his letter?"
12672,"Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge."
12651,"A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of squashy armchairs and tables."
12648,"Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily."
12637,Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody.
12612,Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody's bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.
12549,Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.
12547,The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins.
12519,"Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons."
12461,I mean - they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety. . .
12415,"Harry didn't like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket."
12407,"Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair."
12294,"We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though."
12222,"Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald-green skull."
12186,Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.
12183,"Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams."
12172,It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing.
12161,He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step.
12118,The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished.
12073,"Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns."
12068,But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval.
12033,"Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field."
12032,"He had become distracted, and Harry couldn't blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight."
12019,Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen.
11991,"Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck."
11980,Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb.
11979,"Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed."
11927,"Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father."
11886,"The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato."
11875,"Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself."
11752,"They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around."
11656,"For those who don't want to Apparate, or can't, we use Portkeys."
11655,I believe there's a handy wood they're using as the Apparition point.
11552,"And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won't answer to anything else."
11515,"Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Mr."
11496,"Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen  tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off."
11483,Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better.
11423,"Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified."
11383,The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable.
11305,"He had almost said ""Hogwarts Express,"" and that was a sure way to get his uncle's temper up."
11241,"When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley's plate with a tremulous ""There you are, Diddy darling,"" Dudley glowered at her."
11235,"Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more."
11206,But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather - for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.
11201,The home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer.
11200,"Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run."
11071,There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open.
11046,He was talking about it without any kind of remorse  -  with amusement.
11024,"How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours?"
11012,"They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything."
11007,"Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard."
10947,"Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse."
10939,"Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied."
10891,"He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it."
10879,"I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it,"" said Ron grumpily."
10876,"As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news."
10855,"Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so  cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits."
10748,Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying.
10719,"Down one staircase, then another, along a new ,corridor  -  then they heard a cackling ahead."
10692,Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it.
10666,"He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them."
10655,"Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes."
10635,"On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished."
10479,"It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch."
10444,She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one.
10418,"But remember this, both of you: you must not be seen."
10321,A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak.
10307,"They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer...."
10294,The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake.
10238,Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it.
10215,Er  -  perhaps it will be best if we don't revive him until we're safety back in the castle.
10186,"Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach."
10183,But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.
10153,Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times.
10141,"But you, Peter  -  I'll never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start."
10049,"I  - ""  What little color there was in Blacks face left it."
10040,It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.
10003,"And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames."
9997,"Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it."
9995,They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak.
9959,"Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows."
9949,"Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed."
9941,"Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared."
9920,"He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand."
9881,"The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready."
9852,"Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron's wands."
9812,Hermione's grip on Harry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers.
9773,"Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll  -   Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again."
9754,"By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them."
9684,"They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward."
9616,"All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join in."
9614,"Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall."
9594,"Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts."
9546,"Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down  -   Horrified, he looked around."
9500,"In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, ""Okay, it's time, let's go  - ""  They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise."
9494,"Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions."
9459,"First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, ""Where were you?"
9452,All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match.
9441,"Malfoy was still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment."
9412,"One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs...."
9355,She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster.
9352,I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had.
9189,Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
9130,Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking.
9121,WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN.
9043,"Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets."
9034,"Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased."
8946,"If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a slight list to the tail end  -  you often find they develop a drag after a few years."
8943,"In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd finished."
8930,"Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered."
8865,"Even so, he was showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her."
8864,"This meant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework."
8808,"Professor Lupin continued, ""The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon  -  hope, happiness, the desire to survive  -  but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it."
8770,"He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him  - ""  ""Imagine that,"" said Professor McGonagall dryly."
8700,"Then he said quietly, ""Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him fly away... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go inter hidin'?"
8665,Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.
8651,Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in mind.
8483,Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them.
8464,Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it  -  it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there.
8462,"Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge."
8460,"Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening."
8457,"A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet...."
8391,"Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful."
8337,No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.
8327,"Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit."
8223,Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms.
8222,The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn.
8172,"There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of thunder."
7959,Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
7930,"Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes."
7929,"Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly."
7858,"He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals."
7691,Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch.
7676,"She went on, more calmly, ""Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic."
7624,"A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it."
7587,"But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass."
7532,"It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair."
7475,"Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face."
7473,He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor.
7453,But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.
7437,"As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows."
7321,One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day.
7288,"Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered."
7252,"He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books onto his bed."
7239,"As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him."
7179,"I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and  ""Hang on,"" blurted Harry."
7137,"The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed."
7072,Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet.
7057,"He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand."
7045,"Harry was sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them."
7029,"He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents."
6977,Don't rise  Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.
6952,"Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door."
6946,"She was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his."
6902,"She didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry's mind."
6896,"She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors."
6874,Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign.
6842,Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams.
6801,Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had snapped.
6796,Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them.
6776,"One of them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig."
6745,Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays.
6736,"The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley."
6717,"Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all because he'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation."
6705,"The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays."
6610,"And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,"" he added thoughtfully."
6577,Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished?
6570,"I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it  - ""  ""Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,"" Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice."
6565,"He disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable."
6543,"She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter."
6452,"Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it."
6431,"He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming  There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall."
6425,And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth.
6340,"Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet."
6239,"Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground."
6179,"They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom."
6167,"If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms."
6159,"No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves."
6071,"Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it."
6021,"Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified."
6013,It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state.
5940,"Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow."
5920,"Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron."
5863,"The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded."
5829,Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed.
5804,It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; he'd let out an audible gasp.
5796,"Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -""  ""Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,"" said Dumbledore."
5786,"He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man."
5734,Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.
5711,Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.
5643,"He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off."
5629,"As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school."
5612,"Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice."
5592,A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident.
5554,"Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor."
5505,"The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish."
5381,"She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them."
5340,"They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny- faced and looking anxious."
5331,"Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths."
5306,"She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys."
5274,"Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes."
5247,"The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames."
5202,"Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane."
5201,"He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him."
5200,"Yeh look all hot an' bothered -""  Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him."
5135,He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls.
5091,"There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor."
5082,"The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead."
5067,"Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class."
5040,The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion.
4939,A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips.
4797,"As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past."
4639,"She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles."
4619,They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.
4617,"As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard."
4585,"Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents."
4577,"With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic."
4558,"So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor."
4395,"Her fellow Chasers, Katie  *107*  Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them."
4303,"Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed."
4178,"When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower."
4134,"He began to read aloud: ""Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ..."
4119,Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher.
4057,"London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches."
3975,"When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers."
3898,"Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch."
3791,"Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched."
3781,"The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY what a garden should be."
3759,"Cargone - could have crashed - out of my  mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -""  ""Perfect Percy,"" muttered Fred."
3718,"Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window."
3712,"Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron."
3674,"The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp."
3665,"Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."
3643,"There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon  burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding."
3601,"But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later..."
3585,Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this.
3570,Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
3551,"Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face."
3523,He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.
3474,"THE WORST BIRTHDAY  Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive."
3414,Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.
3301,It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone.
3274,"There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it...."
3239,"He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them  -  for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire  -  then he was on the other side, in the last chamber."
3182,He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse.
3161,"They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one."
3150,"He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened."
3086,"As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything."
3080,Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak.
3072,"He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight."
3058,"Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break."
3031,"Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do."
2920,"Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves."
2887,"Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately?"
2868,"Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away."
2821,"Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too."
2801,Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.
2727,"Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate."
2709,Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.
2700,Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me.
2677,Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak.
2625,"He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't."
2586,They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones.
2574,"He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard."
2538,"As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped  -  then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face."
2507,Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
2486,"Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms."
2463,"The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too."
2427,There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.
2406,Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
2360,"It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet."
2334,"Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be."
2325,Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.
2299,Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.
2179,The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.
2086,"It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath."
2020,"Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said ""Thanks,"" and hurried off to get plates."
1971,"It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape."
1839,All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.
1764,The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
1738,"Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle."
1733,Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
1710,"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him."
1647,Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.
1603,When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.
1590,"He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like."
1589,Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
1585,"As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite."
1561,"It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls."
1540,"Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards."
1531,Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.
1522,"Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for."
1513,"He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing."
1461,"No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape."
1451,"On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (""I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-""; ""You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing  -  "")."
1437,I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year?
1428,Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
1246,"Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget."
1201,The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.
1191,"Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared."
1105,"The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg."
1052,Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep.
976,"We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons."
944,A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
916,He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy.
910,"Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length."
882,"Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor."
814,The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in.
796,"He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow."
691,"Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them."
683,"That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh  -  took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even  -  but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry."
646,"How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was?"
617,"He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad."
610,"An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts  -  yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course."
580,There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room.
503,"Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway."
426,His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.
425,"Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon."
423,"He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope."
410,They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.
348,"As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, ""Brazil, here I come...."
314,"Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone."
299,"I had a dream about a motorcycle,"" said Harry, remembering suddenly."
249,Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel  -  Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
239,He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose.
209,"One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley..."
185,"If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it."
172,Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.
164,Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder.
135,"Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat."
134,"If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement."
125,"He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something."
78,"Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house."
19,"For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen  -  then he jerked his head around to look again."
18,It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar  -  a cat reading a map.
16,"At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls."
3,"Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills."
