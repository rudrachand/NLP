      "i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \r\n",
      " \" shine \" was one bookend . \r\n",
      "stand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \r\n",
      ">from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \r\n",
      "the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \r\n",
      "bryan | brown . \r\n",
      "in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \r\n",
      "the local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man's justice \" to the aboriginals . \r\n",
      "these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \r\n",
      "naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \r\n",

      "he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \r\n",

      "the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \r\n",

      "whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \r\n",
      "he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \r\n",
      "she appears to not know this . \r\n",

      "it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \r\n",
      "the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \r\n",
      "the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \r\n",
      "at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \r\n",
      "in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \r\n",
