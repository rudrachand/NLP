Around 19:00, when Chen XX walked to the end of UW, he found that the compressed air pipelines and the dust collection pipelines seemed to have been connected to the molding.

So Chen XX went forward to observe and confirmed it, and there was no warning sign around. However, he wanted to unplug the compressed air pipes, but he did not close the valve of the compressed air pipe first and open the pressure relief valve for pressure relief.

P2 and P3 accessed tower to nacelle while P1 waited for the hub to align with the rotor lock. Once hub was locked P2 accessed the hub via the nacelle hatch and hub rear entry hatch. P2 descended into the hub and disconnected his lanyards focusing on placement of feet and greasy surfaces. Once in the hub area P2 noticed that axis 1 battery cabinet cover was missing. As P2 moved to take a look at the cabinet he touched a wire with exposed conductor. Unknown to P2, he continued to examine the cabinet and as he touched the metalwork, he received a shock. P2 remained still and called to P1, who was in the nacelle hatch. P2 requested P1 to isolate all power in the hub immediately. P1 isolated the power to the hub. P2 then moved to check the surrounds and realized he was touching the exposed wire from a missing light fitting. P1 entered the hub and P1 and P2 checked to ensure all power was isolated.

Whilst in the turret, residue transformer oil dripped onto the Operatives face and safety glasses and ended up in Operatives eyes causing mild irritation.   Operative sought First Aid treatment and then returned to his workplace.",UK,Anthony Powell,"The limitation of access to the cleat bar connection to the LV bushing was initially noted in manufacturing at the final assembly stage of the first 150MVA unit 01.  At this stage engineering agreed the existing access was limited and a further handhole was required in the LV turret local to the connection to enable both connection of the cleat bar cable to the bushing stem and handling of the corona shield during the connection.  The LV turret drawing was amended accordingly and these revised turrets are being supplied for all four units for site erection.  See Drg  33CX26070-02 attached issued 14/01/20.    

Production continued with the use of the existing handhole, as although far from ideal, connection of the bushing was physically possible.  This was on the understanding that the operatives take the necessary precautions especially during removal of the bushing when the environment would be oily.

Root causes 
1.	Limitation of access not picked up in engineering checking.  – Use of a formal checklist is bein
2.	Poor attendance of drawing review meetings -  (the Cleat bar (leads) drawing review was attended by  TOT (2) , Quality (1) and Engineering (1)

When doing so the cut saw jerked away into the other employees upper left arm.,US,Nicholas Marshall,"On Wednesday March 4th 2020 at about 3:15pm we had an incident. I was told one of my employees was hurt by a cut saw. When I got to the scene Pedro was already being treated by our EMR & site nurse. When I asked Pedro what happened he said he didn’t know? I assumed he was in shock at the time due to the laceration on his arm. I then went to the exact spot where the incident happened and started investigating. Joe who was cutting flashing next to Pedro. Joe said he was cutting towards Pedro and then put his cut saw down. He stated when he was lowering the cut saw the cut saw was still running. The cut saw that was running then hit the scaffolding railing, bounced off and hit Pedro in the arm. We really couldn’t wrap our heads around it and were not getting any information from Pedro. Pedro was brought into the ER where he received 9 stitches. We stopped work in the department within 10-15 minutes of the incident and called Mike Holter from HSE, & James Peltier Post Moulding Manager. We discussed the incident with the team, at least what we knew! We again explained the importance of slowing down & working safe.

Establish Boundaries -We have never established what a “safe” working distance is between employees. We will now update training & JSA’s to reflect what the safe distances are. In our case we are moving to one employee per piece of scaffolding with a cut saw. JSA Updates -Make sure the cutting JSA states that operators must release trigger after making cuts. As well as what the boundaries are and clear instructions on how to properly remove flashing from the blade & cut up once removed from the blade.
